Constructor should be private
Object should be created with the help of method.
create field to store object is private.
Two types of initialisation of objects :- Lazy way(create object when needed) and Eager way(Create object very early).
Threads are executed concurrently.


How to avoid Thread safety failure in case of lazy way of initialisation :-

if(samoosa==NULL){
    synchronized (Samosa.class) {
        if(samosa==NULL){
            samosa= new Samosa();
        }
    }
}
